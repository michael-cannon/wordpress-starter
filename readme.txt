* Initial release


== Beta Testers Needed ==

I really want WordPress Starter and WordPress Starter Premium to be the best WordPress plugins of their type. However, it's beyond me to do it alone.

I need beta testers to help with ensuring pending releases of WordPress Starter and WordPress Starter Premium are solid. This would benefit us all by helping reduce the number of releases and raise code quality.

[Please contact me directly](http://aihr.us/contact-aihrus/).

Beta testers benefit directly with latest versions, a free 1-site license for WordPress Starter Premium, and personalized support assistance.

== TODO ==

Is there something you want done? Write it up on the [support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-starter-plugin) and then [donate](http://aihr.us/about-aihrus/donate/) or [write an awesome testimonial](http://aihr.us/about-aihrus/testimonials/add-testimonial/).
